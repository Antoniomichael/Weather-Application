Logical flow:

   Weather and notification aspect:
        1. Retrieve Json Object from api call
        2. Isolate the weather for each day and pass that to an object (This data should be autonomous but should also not be
            endless  loop so something has to keep track of what day an alert was sent for, if one was sent to ensure that
            multiple notifications are sent for a specific day due to the transactions being autonomous)

            NB. For the weather api days were in arrays and within each element in the array was an array of weather. That was tricky,
            had to store the days array, then, access each weather in the array and stored that in an array, then, I was able to access
            element in the weather array which stated if it was raining or not, that was welcomed conquest.

        3. weather has to be stored for the next 5 days based on locations (maybe to a file, or to the database)
            (using java.time to retrieve dates from present going forward)

        4. if date after current date's weather is going to be rainy notification should be sent
